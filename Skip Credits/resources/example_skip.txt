#File must be named `skip.txt` or `*[video filename]*skip.txt`, and be in the same folder as the video file

#First time is always the point when it skips ("start time")
#Second time is always the point it skips to ("stop time")

#Format for each time is `dd:hh:mm:ss` - with dd, hh,and  mm optional.
#Allows decimal seconds as `ss.n`, with no set limit to the number of decimal places.
#Skipping less than 1s is not recommended, as Kodi takes that long to perform a skip.

#Start and stop time must be separated with `-` such that `1-2` would (hypothetically) skip from 1s to to 3s
#If no stop time is provided, it skips to the end (do NOT include a `-`)

#If time stop is amount to skip (eg 10s from 1m0s), must be in seconds
#If time stop is only seconds, it is assumed to be the amount to skip
#If start time is zero, there's no difference - skipping forward 70 seconds is the same thing as skipping to 1m10s

#Skips forward 50 seconds at 10 and 1/2s (ie from 10.5s to 1m00s)
10.5-50

#Skips from 10.5s to 0m50s
10.5-0:50

#Same as above
1:42:00-60
#Invalid time, stating to go from 1h42m00s backwards to 1m00s
#Reversed times are ignored
1:42:00-1:00

#Season/episodes must be in SXXEYY format, where XX is the season and YY is episode.
#X and Y may be any number of digits (including 1 digit)
#If no season or episode is indicated, applies to all seasons and episodes
#If only season is indicated, applies to all episodes in the season
#Episode only is not permitted (they wil be ignored)
#Times can be nested between show, season and episode
